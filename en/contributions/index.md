## Blog (docs.velosofize.com)

See [this page](blog/)

## Routes in the map (map.velosofize.com)

See [this form](https://forms.gle/aDKQuRDcbVQXFw8t7) to contribute with routes in and around major cities in Bulgaria. Bike lanes would be more useful when submitted to OpenStreetMap. A section for them is included below.

## Other content on the site

### Bike paths and amenities

Bike paths, drinking fountains, bicycle parking spots and other amenities can be submitted to OpenStreetMap [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit). There is a tutorial as well.

Submitting your changes to a global project makes it accessible to way more people than strictly for users of Velosofize or for users from Bulgaria. Velosofize itself would not have been possible without the open-source projects related to OpenStreetMap and all of your successful changes to OSM will eventually be reflected in Velosofize Map automatically.

### Mountain bike routes
