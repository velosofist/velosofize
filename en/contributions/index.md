## Map (map.velosofize.com)

### Routes

See [this form](https://forms.gle/aDKQuRDcbVQXFw8t7) to contribute with routes in and around major cities in Bulgaria. Bike lanes would be more useful when submitted to OpenStreetMap. A section for them is included below.

### Code

Feel free to suggest any changes to the codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/velosofist/velosofize-map). Issues with potential topics for research or direct contributions are also available to help you in choosing how to help!

I started this project with no knowledge of web development or GIS and have been learning JS ad-hoc for whatever was needed for a feature, so any improvements in maintainability, UI/UX or security would be much appreciated. Keep in mind that the codebase is a work-in-progress and partially vibe-coded.

### Bike paths and amenities

Bike paths, drinking fountains, bicycle parking spots and other amenities can be submitted to OpenStreetMap [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit). There is a tutorial as well.

Submitting your changes to a global project makes it accessible to way more people than strictly for users of Velosofize or for users from Bulgaria. Velosofize itself would not have been possible without the open-source projects related to OpenStreetMap and all of your successful changes to OSM will eventually be reflected in Velosofize Map automatically.

### Mountain bike routes
