### CyclOSM

[CyclOSM](cyclosm.org) is based on an open-source project called OpenStreetMap and seems to have the best coverage of official bike lanes in Bulgaria and international routes. It is, however, **not** accessible thorugh Google's various services and is therefore not equivalent to the goals of this current project, which aims to be as widely available as possible on software that most Bulgarian mobile users already have and understand. Furthermore, it doesn't seem to support satellite imagery, Street and 3D view, which are very helpful when planning a route.
CyclOSM focuses on a **more objective approach to cycling routes**, as it aims to document existing dedicated infrastructure and not reflect subjective opinions of contributors.

"CyclOSM is a bicycle-oriented map built on top of [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org) data. It aims at providing a beautiful and practical map for cyclists, no matter their cycling habits or abilities.
In urban areas, it renders the main different types of cycle tracks and lanes, on each side of the road, for helping you draw your bike to work route. It also features essential POIs as well as bicycle parking spots or spots shared with motorbikes, specific infrastructure (elevators / ramps), road speeds or surfaces to avoid streets with pavings, bumpers and bike boxes, etc.
The map is available by default in the following smartphone applications:
[OSMAnd](https://osmand.net/), [All-In-One Offline Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.psyberia.offlinemaps) or [AlpineQuest Rando GPS](https://alpinequest.net/) and [OpenMultiMaps](https://framagit.org/tom79/openmaps)."
